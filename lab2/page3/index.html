          And first let me talk about the,
           a little bit about the, improvement in the 
           techniques of terrorism. I think there have been 
           improvements. Pavlov after all made some extremely 
           profound observations both on animals and on human 
           beings. And he found among other things that conditioning 
           techniques applied to animals or humans in a state either 
           of psychological or physical stress sank in so to say, 
           very deeply into the mind-body of the creature, and were 
           extremely difficult to get rid of. That they seemed to be 
           embedded more deeply than other forms of conditioning.

            And this of course, this fact was 
            discovered empirically in the past. 
            People did make use of many of these 
            techniques, but the difference between 
            the old empirical intuitive methods and our 
            own methods is the difference between the, a 
            sort of, hit and miss craftsman’s point of 
            view and the genuinely scientific point of 
            view. I think there is a real difference between 
            ourselves and say the inquisitors of the 16th century. 
            We know much more precisely what we are doing, than 
            they knew and we can extend because of our theoretical 
            knowledge, we can extend what we are doing over a wider 
            area with a greater assurance of being producing 
            something that really works.

          In this context I would like to mention the extremely 
          interesting chapters in Dr. William Seargent’s Battle 
          for the Mind where he points out how intuitively some 
          of the great religious teachers/leaders of the past hit 
          on the Pavlovian method, he speaks specifically of Wesley’s 
          method of producing conversions which were essentially based 
          on the technique of heightening psychological stress to the 
          limit by talking about hellfire and so making people extremely 
          vulnerable to suggestion and then suddenly releasing this stress 
          by offering hopes of heaven and this is a very interesting chapter 
          of showing how completely on purely intuitive and empirical grounds 
          a skilled natural psychologist, as Wesley was, could discover these Pavlovian methods.</p>

          Well, as I say, we now know the reason why these techniques 
          worked and there’s no doubt at all that we can if we wanted 
          to, carry them much further than was possible in the past. 
          And of course in the history of, recent history of brainwashing, 
          both as applied to prisoners of war and to the lower personnel 
          within the communist party in China, we see that the pavlovian 
          methods have been applied systematically and with evidently with 
          extraordinary efficacy. I think there can be no doubt that by the 
          application of these methods a very large army of totally devoted 
          people has been created. The conditioning has been driven in, so to 
          say, by a kind of psychological iontophoresis into the very depths 
          of the people’s being, and has got so deep that it’s very difficult 
          to ever be rooted out, and these methods, I think, are a real refinement 
          on the older methods of terror because they combine methods of terror with 
          methods of acceptance that the person who is subjected to a form of terroristic 
          stress but for the purpose of inducing a kind of voluntary quotes acceptance of 
          the state the psychological state in which he has been driven and the state of 
          affairs in which he finds himself.</p>
