                        of this kind of ultimate revolution, a method of control by which
                         a people can be made to enjoy a state of affairs by which any 
                         decent standard they ought not to enjoy. This, the enjoyment of
                          servitude, Well this process is, as I say, has gone on for over
                      the years, and I have become more and more interested in what 
                      is happening.
                    And here I would like briefly to compare
                       the parable of Brave New World with another
                        parable which was put forth more recently 
                        in George Orwell’s book, Nineteen Eighty- Four.

                    Orwell wrote his book between, I think between 45
                     and 48 at the time when the Stalinist terror 
                     regime was still in Full swing and just after 
                     the collapse of the Hitlerian terror regime. 
                     And his book which I admire greatly, it’s a 
                     book of very great talent and extraordinary ingenuity,
                      shows, so to say, a projection into the future of the 
                      immediate past, of what for him was the immediate past, 
                      and the immediate present, it was a projection into the 
                      future of a society where control was exercised wholly by 
                      terrorism and violent attacks upon the mind-body of individuals.

                <p>Whereas my own book which was written in 1932 when there was
                        only a mild dictatorship in the form of Mussolini in existence, 
                        was not overshadowed by the idea of terrorism, and I was therefore 
                        free in a way in which Orwell was not free, to think about these other 
                        methods of control, these non-violent methods and my, I’m inclined to 
                        think that the scientific dictatorships of the future, and I think there 
                        are going to be scientific dictatorships in many parts of the world, will 
                        be probably a good deal nearer to the brave new world pattern than to the 
                        1984 pattern, they will a good deal nearer not because of any humanitarian 
                        qualms of the scientific dictators but simply because the BNW pattern is probably 
                        a good deal more efficient than the other.

                  which they’re living. The state of servitude the state of being, having 
                  their differences ironed out, and being made amenable to mass production 
                  methods on the social level, if you can do this, then you have, you are likely, 
                  to have a much more stable and lasting society. Much more easily controllable 
                  society than you would if you were relying wholly on clubs and firing squads and 
                  concentration camps. So that my own feeling is that the 1984 picture was tinged 
                  of course by the immediate past and present in which Orwell was living, but the 
                  past and present of those years does not reflect, I feel, the likely trend of what 
                  is going to happen, needless to say we shall never get rid of terrorism, it will 
                  always find its way to the surface.</h2>

                <p>But I think that insofar as dictators become more and more 
                    scientific, more and more concerned with the technically perfect,
                     perfectly running society, they will be more and more interested 
                     in the kind of techniques which I imagined and described from existing 
                     realities in BNW. So that, it seems to me then, that this ultimate revolution
                      is not really very far away, that we, already a number of techniques for 
                      bringing about this kind of control are here, and it remains to be seen when 
                      and where and by whom they will first be applied in any large scale.
