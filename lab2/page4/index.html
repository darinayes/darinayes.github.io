                <h2> So there is, as I say, has been a definite improvement 
                  in the techniques of terrorism. But then we come to 
                  the consideration of other techniques, non-terroristic techniques, 
                  for inducing consent and inducing people to love their servitude. 
                  Here, I don’t think I can possibly go into all of them, because I don’t 
                  know all of them, but I mean I can mention the more obvious methods, 
                  which can now be used and are based on recent scientific findings. First 
                  of all there are the methods connected with straight suggestion and hypnosis.

                    I think we know much more about this subject than was known in the past. 
                    People of course, always have known about suggestion, and although they 
                    didn’t know the word ‘hypnosis’ they certainly practiced it in various ways. 
                    But we have, I think, a much greater knowledge of the subject than in the past, 
                    and we can make use of our knowledge in ways, which I think the past was never 
                    able to make use of it. For example, one of the things we now know for certain, 
                    that there is of course an enormous, I mean this has always been known a very great 
                    difference between individuals in regard to their suggestibility. But we now know pretty 
                    clearly the sort of statistical structure of a population in regard to its suggestibility. 
                    Its very interesting when you look at the findings of different fields, I mean the field of 
                    hypnosis, the field of administering placebos, for example, in the field of general suggestion 
                    in states of drowsiness or light sleep you will find the same sorts of orders of magnitude 
                    continually cropping up.

                    Orwell wrote his book between, I think between 45
                     and 48 at the time when the Stalinist terror 
                     regime was still in Full swing and just after 
                     the collapse of the Hitlerian terror regime. 
                     And his book which I admire greatly, it’s a 
                     book of very great talent and extraordinary ingenuity,
                      shows, so to say, a projection into the future of the 
                      immediate past, of what for him was the immediate past, 
                      and the immediate present, it was a projection into the 
                      future of a society where control was exercised wholly by 
                      terrorism and violent attacks upon the mind-body of individuals.

                <h2>You’ll find for example that the experienced hypnotist 
                  will tell one that the number of people, the percentage of 
                  people who can be hypnotized with the utmost facility (snaps), 
                  just like that. is about 20%, and about a corresponding number at the 
                  other end of the scale are very, very difficult or almost impossible to 
                  hypnotize. But in between lies a large mass of people who can with more 
                  or less difficulty be hypnotized, that they can gradually be if you work 
                  hard enough at it be got into the hypnotic state, and in the same way the 
                  same sort of figures crop up again, for example in relation to the 
                  administration of placebos.

                <p>Whereas my own book which was written in 1932 when there was
                        only a mild dictatorship in the form of Mussolini in existence, 
                        was not overshadowed by the idea of terrorism, and I was therefore 
                        free in a way in which Orwell was not free, to think about these other 
                        methods of control, these non-violent methods and my, I’m inclined to 
                        think that the scientific dictatorships of the future, and I think there 
                        are going to be scientific dictatorships in many parts of the world, will 
                        be probably a good deal nearer to the brave new world pattern than to the 
                        1984 pattern, they will a good deal nearer not because of any humanitarian 
                        qualms of the scientific dictators but simply because the BNW pattern is probably 
                        a good deal more efficient than the other.

                <h2>A big experiment was carried out three of four years ago in the general hospital 
                  in Boston on post-operative cases where several hundred men and woman suffering 
                  comparable kinds of pain after serious operations were allowed to, were given 
                  injections whenever they asked for them whenever the pain got bad, and the injections 
                  were 50% of the time were of morphine, and 50% of water. And about twenty percent 
                  of those who went through the experiment, about 20% of them got just as much relief 
                  from the distilled waters as from the morphea. About 20% got no relief from the 
                  distilled water, and in- between were those who got some relief or got relief occasionally.</h2>

                <p>So yet again, we see the same sort of distribution, and similarly in regard to what 
                  in BNW I called Hypnopedia, the sleep teaching, I was talking not long ago to a man 
                  who manufactures records which people can listen to in the, during the light part of 
                  sleep, I mean these are records for getting rich, for sexual satisfaction, for confidence 
                  in salesmanship and so on, and he said that its very interesting that these are records 
                  sold on a money-back basis, and he says there is regularly between 15% and 20% of people 
                  who write indignantly saying the records don’t work at all, and he sends the money back 
                  at once. There are on the other hand, there are over 20% who write enthusiastically saying 
                  they are much richer, their sexual life is much better (laughter) etc, etc. And these of 
                  course are the dream clients and they buy more of these records. And in between there are 
                  those who don’t get much results and they have to have letters written to them saying “Go 
                  persist my dear, go on” and you will get there, and they generally do get results in the long run.

                  <h2>Well, as I say, on the basis of this, I think we see quite 
                    clearly that the human populations can be categorized according to 
                    their suggestibility fairly clearly,. I suspect very strongly that 
                    this twenty percent is the same in all these cases, and I suspect also 
                    that it would not be at all difficult to recognize and {garbled} out 
                    who are those who are extremely suggestible and who are those extremely 
                    unsuggestible and who are those who occupy the intermediate space. Quite 
                    clearly, if everybody were extremely unsuggestible organized society would 
                    be quite impossible, and if everybody were extremely suggestible then a 
                    dictatorship would be absolutely inevitable. I mean it’s very fortunate 
                    that we have people who are moderately suggestible in the majority and who 
                    therefore preserve us from dictatorship but do permit organized society to 
                    be formed. But, once given the fact that there are these 20% of highly suggestible 
                    people, it becomes quite clear that this is a matter of enormous political importance, 
                    for example, any demagogue who is able to get hold of a large number of these 20% of 
                    suggestible people and to organize them is really in a position to overthrow any 
                    government in any country.</h2>
